This will \nnot be true where there are over-year storage effects (e.g. in reservoirs or aquifers) or where there are \nsignificant errors in the components in the water balance. However, once a reasonably satisfactory \nbalance has been achieved there can be confidence that the hydrology of the catchment has b een \nproperly appraised. \n3.2 CATCHMENT AREAS \nA precise knowledge of the catchment area draining to  a surface water source is an  essential pre-\nrequisite for any hydrological assessment of that source. Where this is not known, it must be deter-\nmined, usually from an examination of contours on a topographic map. \nThe catchment boundary is  located by  defining the direction of downhill flow  at right angles \nto  the contour lines. Particular care must be taken \nin areas of low relief and where water-courses, \nmarked on maps, appear to cross the catchment divide. \nIf not the top pound of a canal, these water-\ncourse may well  be a contour leat or catchwater designed to augment the flow  into a reservoir or \nto \nbring water to a mili or mine from an  adjacent catchment. Field visits to  key sections of the topo-\ngraphic divide may be required to resol ve uncertainties, identify apparent cross-boundary channels \nand check whether they are active or derelict, thereby carrying \nno flow in or out the catchment. \nLarge scale maps showing topography in sufficient detail can be  hard to obtain \nin sorne parts of \nthe world. For very large basins, satellite imagery now  widely available on  the Internet may prove \nadequate. Alternatively, 500 000 scale maps produced by the USA Air Force \nin their 'World Tactical \nPilotage' series (obtainable in UK from the Director of Military Survey, Ministry ofDefence or major \nmapsellers) are recommended. Large inaccessible basins can be examined from satellite photographs, \nlibraries of which are now available internationally. However, the best sources are those giving digital \ndescriptions of terrain and rivers, now on CD-ROM; the most detailed global coverage is emerging \nfrom ESRI, Redlands, California, the major American geographic information software company. \nCatchment areas can be determined quickly from GIS systems and by the use of digital terrain \nmodels. These include computer programs that will define a catchment boundary from any gridded \ndata set.  One such program, available from the Centre for Ecology and  Hydrology (CEH), per-\nmüs catchment area and numerous other parameters to be computed for any catchment in the UK \n(NERC, 2006). However, care must be taken on small catchments ( \n<10 km\n2\n) \nand in areas of low \nrelief where the stream drainage network is poorly defined.

However, there are  cases where surface and \ngroundwater catchments differ markedly, making precise catchment water balance calculations dif-\nficult \nor impossible. Groundwater catchment divides can migrate seasonally, especially in response \nto \npumped abstractions. Monitoring networks need to have very high densities of observation wells \nin \norder to track these  variations, but is rarely practicable except under research funding. \n3.3 DATA COLLECTION \nGood hydrological data forms the basis on which water schemes must be planned and designed. \nThe collection, archiving and dissemination of hydrological data are expensive. It is usually a \ngovernment funded activity. This funding can be vulnerable when governments try to reduce \npublic spending as the impact is not felt immediately and the benefits of data collection are not \nalways obvious. However, it has been demonstrated that the availability of reliable hydrological \ndata results in benefits an order of magnitude larger than the costs of collection (Simpson, 1987). \nThe need for more data is particularly important where climatic or environmental conditions are \nchanging and water supplies are critica!. In Nigeria, for example, it was reported in 1998 that \nfailure of a number of large scale resource developments to achieve their forecasted output was \npartly due to the absence of accurate data on rainfall and river flows (Tor, 1998). If large capital \nsums are not to be wasted, the basic hydrological data on which water schemes are designed \nmust be adequate and reliable. Where good hydrological data are available, very large savings \ncan be made. \nTo assess a potential surface \nwater source the prime need is for long streamflow records. Simi-\nlarly, for \nground water sources, long records of changing aquifer water levels are required. Stream-\nflow records need to \nbe naturalized (Section 3.9) to eliminate the effects of any artificial influences. \nFor this, details are required of ali abstractions, effluent returns and reservoir storage changes in the \ncatchment. Similarly, in \norder to interpret changes in groundwater levels correctly, details should be \nkept of pumped output from wells together with pumping and rest water levels. \nBefore embarking on detailed analyses, it is essential to check the validity of ali ba sic data used. \nThis may involve visits to monitoring sites to \ncheck their condition and probable degree of accuracy. \nIf relevant data do not exist, temporary gauges or permanent systems must be set up to acquire it. \nOnce data is obtained it should be carefully filed or computer-archived so that it is permanently avail-\nable for subsequent analyses such as updating yield estimates \nwhen catchment or other conditions \nchange. \n3.4 STREAMFLOW MEASUREMENT \nRiver or stream flow records taken in the vicinity of an existing or proposed intake or dam site are \nan invaluable aid to the \nassessment of the potential yield of a source. The longer the period of record \nthe more reliable any yield estimates are likely to be but even a very short record is often a signifi-\ncant improvement over estimates derived from generalized regional relationships. \nFlows are often obtained by \nmeasuring the 'stage leve!' of a river i.e.   the elevation at sorne loca-\ntion \nof the water surface above an arbitrary zero datum. Continuous or regular measurements of \nstage are then converted to discharge by means of a rating curve.

Although s uch gauges are simple  and inexpensive, they must be read \nfrequently when the  water level is  changing rapidly to define the shape of the  streamflow hydro-\ngraph. It is preferable to construct a stilling well to house a data logger or chart recorder connected \nto a shaft encoder, pressure transducer or float. El ectronic data loggers have marked advantages for \ndata processing but the chart record gives an important visual check of existing conditions and may \nstill have a role to play in areas without a power supply or in providing a backup record. \nA rating curve for  a site can  be  obtained in a variety of ways of which the two  most common \nare by means of velocity-area methods using a current meter (USOS, 1968), or by means of weirs \n(Section 12.14) or flumes (Section 12.15) which are mostly permanent structures. The latter include: \nsharp edged plate weirs (BS 3680, 1981); \nbroad crested weirs (Bos, 1990); \ntriangular profile weirs (Herschy, 1977); \ncritica! depth flumes (Ackers, 1978). \nDilution gauging (USOS, 1985) and ultrasonic gauging (BS EN 6416: 2005) can also be used \nto \nhelp define the stage/discharge relationship at sites where conditions are difficult for cu rrent meter \nmeasurements and  to  check an  existing rating curve. The choice of gauging method depends on \nch annel and streamflow ch aracteristics, staff time availability and cost. \nCurrent meter measurements are  most often used  when large flows have to be measured and  the \navailable fall is small. They are al so often desirable for smaller rivers with sediment laden flows. Cur-\nrent meter gauging stations are relatively easy to set up since they often require little modification of \nthe  existing ch annel. Since each potential gauging site is unique, each requires a careful pre-assessment \nof the  width and  depth of the  channel, likely flood velocities and  alternative ways of current meter \nmeasurement. Wherever possible, current meter gauging stations should be located at accessible sites \nin straight uniform channel reaches with relatively smooth banks, no obstructions and a stable  bed. \nCurrent meter measurements can be made by wading with a current meter attached to a gradu-\nated  wading rod to measure depth. Wading can  usually be carried out safely in water depths are \nabout 1 metre, less if the  stream velocity is more than about 1 mis. Otherwise, current meter obser-\nvations sh ould be carried out from above the water. Where the current is  strong the   current meter \nshould be ballasted with a weight; in extreme cases, this may be so heavy that a crane is necessary. \nAccess may be from the deck of a single  span bridge, a specially constructed cableway or from a \nboat. An  al ternative, which \nis rapidly  gaining  popularity, is the acoustic Doppler current profiler \n(ADCP). This uses ultrasonic technology to measure integrated flow velocity across the river. The \nADCP can be mounted on a boat or dragged across the  surface of a river from the bank on a small \nraft. This has severa! safety and time advantages for the  operator. \nAt current meter stations, the   cross-section is divided into  vertical sections in which velocity \nmeasurements are taken at set depths. The mean velocity in each section is determined and applied \nto the  area it represents. The river discharge is  computed from the sum of the  individual section \nvalues. The number and spacing of the   verticals should be such th  at no section accounts for more \nth an  10% of the river flow. Velocity measurement points are normally l ocated by means of a tagged \ntape or wire stretched across the river or from graduations painted on the deck of a bridge. Detailed \nobservations for many different types of river have shown that the   mean velocity of a vertical can \nbe closely approximated from the mean \nof two observations made at 0.2 and 0.8 of the depth. If the \nwater depth in the vertical section is less than about 0.6 m, or if time is limited, then one   observation \nat 0.6 of the  depth will approximate to the average over the whole

These \nfactors and the difficulty \nof access and gauging when the river is in flood make completing a rat-\ning curve take a long time. The alternative \nof a standard gauging structure, therefore, is often more \nattractive to the engineer, particularly for catchments \nof less than 500 km\n2\n• \nSharp edged plate weirs, of rectangular or vee-shape depending upon the sensitivity required, are \ngenerally only suitable for spring flows or for debris-free small streams. The need \nto keep the weir \nnappe aerated at ali stages limits their use but they are frequently used for low flow surveys as they \ncan be rapidly placed \nin small channels. \nOf ali  the weirs that designers have tried, perhaps the most successful has been that of Crump \n(Herschy, 1977) (Section \n12.14). It has a simple and efficient flow characteristic while operating up \nto the total head at which tailwater reaches 75% of that upstream (relative to crest height). Using the \ncrest tapping designed by Crump it \nis possible to go further and attain reasonable results up to 90% \nsubmergence, but this versatility is  marred by a tendency for the crest tappings to block \nin floods \ncarrying sediment. A minimum head \nof 600 mm  on the weir is  necessary for accuracy, but with \ncompounding \nof the weir crest this can be achieved. The flat-vee variant is another possibility. \nThe accuracy \nof streamflow data obtained from weirs can often be poorer than generally realised. \nLaboratory rating conditions rarely appear in real rivers, deterioration \nof the weir crest and siltation \nupstream, resulting in non-standard approach conditions, can cause errors in excess \nof 10%.  Drown-\ning out \nof the weir at high flows can result in gross over-estimation of flood discharges. \nCritica) depth flumes are appropriate on smaller catchments (area under about 100 \nkm\n2\n), which \nhave a wide \nflow variation and where sensitive results are required. Such flumes force flow to attain \ncritica) depth whatever the upstream head (Section 12.15). A   unique upstream head-discharge rela-\ntionship is then created as for a rectangular throat. \nCalibration \nof an existing sluice structure may be  achieved using formulae derived from \nlaboratory model tests but these should be checked by current meter measurements wherever pos-\nsible. Sometimes long, relatively homogeneous, sluice keeper's  records exist (Sargent, 1992), and \nthe  calibration \nof such sites can  then  produce records of flow of severa! decades in  length for  a \nmodest cost. \nDilution gauging (USGS, 1985) is a flow  measurement technique that \nis particularly well suited \nto small turbulent streams with rocky beds where the shallow depths and high velocities are unsuit-\nable for accurate current meter gaugings. The approach can also be used to calibrate non-standard \ngauging structures. With dilution gauging, the discharge is measured by adding a chemical solution \nof known concentration to the flow and measuring the dilution of the solution sorne distance down-\nstream where the  chemical \nis completely mixed with  the stream flow. Sodium dichromate is the \nmost commonly used chemical although dyes such \nas Rhodomine B have the advantage that they \ncan be easily detected at very low concentrations. With the commonly used 'gulp injection' method \na known volume \nof chemical is added to the stream flow  as quickly as possible in a single 'gulp' \nand  downstream samples are used to  construct a graph \nof concentration against time. It follows \nthat \nif a known volume of chemical V of concentration C1 is added to a streamflow and the varying \ndownstream concentration \nC2 is measured regularly

This gives the \nintegral on the right, hence \nQ can be found. \nUltrasonic gauging uses  the  transmission \nof sound pulses to  measure the  mean velocity at  a \nprescribed depth across a river channel. Two  sets \nof transmüters/receivers are usually located on \neither bank \nof a rectangular channel,  offset at an angle of about 45º to the direction of flow. They \nsend ultrasonic pulses through the water, mean water velocity at pulse leve! being a function \nof the \ndifference in  pulse travel times in  upstream and downstream directions. \nIn essence, ultrasonic flow \nmeasurement \nis a velocity-area method requiring a survey of the channel cross section at the gaug-\ning site. \nIf used in conjunction with a water leve! recorder, ultrasonic measurements can provide a \ncomplete record \nof stream flows. \n3.5 RAINFALL MEASUREMENT \nPrecipitation is measured with a rain  gauge, the majority of which are little more than  standard \ncylindrical vessels so designed that rainfa\nll is stored within them and does not evaporate before it \ncan be measured (WMO, 1983). \nIn an effort to ensure that consistent measurements of the precipi-\ntation reaching the ground are obtained, observers are recommended to use standard instruments, \nwhich are set up \nin a uniform manner in representative locations. Many national meteorological \ninstitutions provide pamphlets designed to ensure good standard observation practice and the World \nMeteorological Organization (WMO) plays \nan effective co-ordinating role. \nThe standard daily rain gauge in \nUK is the Meteorological Office Mark II instrument. lt consists \nof a 127 mm diameter copper cylinder with a chamfered rim made of brass. Precipitation that falls \non  the  rain  gauge orífice drains through a funnel into a removable container from which the  rain \nmay be poured into a graduated gl ass measuring cylinder. Monthly storage gauges are designed to \nmeasure the rainfa\nll in remoter areas and are invaluable on the higher parts of reservoir catchments. \nThe Seathwaite gauge \nis a monthly storage gauge developed for use in the Lake District in north-\nwest England. \nIdeally, rainfall should be measured at ground leve! but this gives rise to problems due \nto rain \nsplashing into the gauge. The higher the rim \nis placed, the more sorne rain will be blown away from \nthe gauge orífice and goes unrecorded. Ali standard storage gauges \nin the United Kingdom are set \ninto the ground with their rims leve]  and 300 mm above the ground surface, which should be cov-\nered by short grass or grave] to prevent any rain splash. Many international gauges are set with their \nrim one metre high: these can be expected \ntoread 3% l   ower than the standard British gauge. \nIn the United Kingdom, daily storage gauges are inspected each day at 09 .00 hours and any rainfall \ncollected \nis attributed to the previous day's  date. If the inner container of a rain gauge should overflow \nas the result of exceptional rainfall, or possibly because of irregular emptying, it is important that the \nsurp\nlus water held in the outer casing should also  be recorded.

{"id":"cmkjtrz56000dv5q845e4y5iz","content":"the standard time \nduring spells \nof wet weather.  6 \ne \n3.5 Rainfall Measurement 69 \nSpecialized problems occur in  snow prone areas. Small quantities of sleet or snow which fa]] \ninto a rain  gauge will  usually melt to yield their water equivalent, but if the snow remains in  the \ncollecting funnel it must be melted to combine with any liquid in  the gauge. \nlf there is deep fresh \nsnow lying on the ground at the time \nof measurement, possibly burying the gauge, acore of the snow \nshould be taken on l\neve! ground and melted to find the equivalent rainfall. Countries with snow cover \nthroughout the winter months require regular snow course surveys (Hudleston, 1933) to  measure \nprecipitation. \nContinuously recording rain  gauges are invaluable for flood studies. The original type gives a \ndaily chart recording \nof the accumulated contents of a rain-filled container, which empties by a tilt-\ning siphon principie each time 5 mm has collected. A  more recent development is the tilting bucket \ngauge linked \nto a logger, which runs for at least one month. Each time the bucket tilts to discharge \n2 mm  the event is  recorded \nin a computer compatible form. A  daily or monthly storage gauge is \noften installed on the same site as a recording gauge to serve as a check gauge and to avoid the pos-\nsibility \nof loss of data due to instrument failure. \nParticular care must be taken when siting a new rain gauge from which the resulting records are \nto be published. The gauge should be placed on leve! ground, ideally in a sheltered location with no \nground falling away steeply on the windward side. Obstructions such \nas trees and buildings, which \naffect local wind \nflow, should be a distance away from the gauge of at least twice their height above \nit.  In particularly exposed locations, such \nas moorlands, it used to  be standard British practice to \ninstall a turf wall (Hudleston, 1933) around the gauge but it has proved difficult to sustain the leve! \nof turf maintenance that is needed. \nRain gauges provide a spot sample \nof the rain  falling over a catchment area. The number of \ngauges required to give a reliable estimate of catchment rainfall increases where rainfall gradients \nare marked. A minimum density \nof 1 per 25 km\n2 \nshould be the target, bearing in mind that signifi-\ncant thunderstorm systems may  be only about 20 km\n2 \nin size. In hilly country, where orographic \neffects may lead to large and consistent rainfall variations in short distances, it may be necessary to \nadopt the high densities suggested in Table 3.1  for the first few years.

In such areas the rain gauge  densities of \nTable 3.1  will be excessive and it is  better to concentrate on obtaining homogeneous records of long \nduration at a few reliable site\ns. \nMeasurement of Catchment Rainfall \nThere are severa! methods for  computing catchment precipitation from rain gauge measurements \nranging from simple numerical procedures, interpolation from isohyetal maps or Thiessen polygons \nand from numerical interpolation procedures \nof which Kriging (Creutin, 1982) and trend surface are \nmost frequently used.

{"id":"cmkjtrz56000fv5q8hcfeercc","content":"method \nof calculating  the average monthly or annual  o \ne \ncatchment rainfall is  to sum the corresponding measurements at all gauges within or close to  the \ncatchment boundaries and to divide the total by the number \nof gauges. The arithmetic mean provides \na reliable estímate provided the whole catchment is \nof similar topography and the rain gauge stations \nare fairly evenly distributed. \nIf accurate values of area rainfall are obtained first from a large number \nof rainfall stations, by one or other of the more time consuming methods described below, the mean \nof the corresponding measurements from a smaller number of stations may provide equally accept-\nable results.  In the Thames Basin, for example, it was found that the annual catchment rainfall, for \nthe 9980 km\n2 \narea, derived from the arithmetic mean of 24 well distributed representative gauges \nwas  within \n±2% of the  value computed by  a more elaborate method using measurements from \n225 stations. \nThe isohyetal method is generally considered to  be the most accurate method of computing \ncatchment rainfall although a good understanding \nof the rainfall of a region is needed to ensure \nits reliability. \nThe monthly or annual rainfall total recorded by each gauge within or close to the \ncatchment boundaries is plotted on a contour base  map. Isohyetal Iines, i.e.  Iines \njoining points \nof equal rainfall, are then drawn on  the map taking into account the likely effects of topography \non the rainfall distribution. \nThe total precipitation over the catchment, for the period considered, \nis  obtained by  measuring the areas between isohyets, by GIS techniques \nor by planimeter. The \nmean catchment rainfall is calculated by summing the products of the areas between each pair of \nisohyets and the corresponding mean rainfall between them, and then dividing by the total catch-\nment area. \nThe most popular method \nof weighting gauge readings objectively by  area has  been that of \nThiessen. An area around each gauge is  obtained by drawing a bisecting perpendicular to the lines \njoining gauges,  as  shown \nin Figure 3.1 .

As a result, measured evaporation is  higher than that \nof a natural water surface anda reduction factor must be applied. This is   generally taken to be 0.7, \nbut it can vary between 0.35, in areas of low humidity, very strong  wind and surrounded by  bare \nsoil and 0.85 where high humidity and light winds prevail (Doorenbos, 1976). The British Symons \nsunken tank is  1.83 m square and 610 \nmm deep, with the rim 75 mm above ground level. It is more \nnearly a model \nof reservoir evaporation but suffers from inconsistent results if it is not in tight con-\ntact with the surrounding ground. The heat storage \nof a small tank is correspondingly small, whereas \na large lake takes time to warm up or cool down. As a consequence, tank results do not quite match \nthe evaporation \nof a nearby lake in regions with strong seasonal temperature variations. Peak lake \nevaporation rates in the Kempton Park experiment (Lapworth, 1965) occurred up  to a month after \npeak tank \nmeasurements; this was explained by heat storage theory. Annual open water evaporation \nranges from 700 \nmm in Northern Europe, through 1500 mm in much of the tropics,  to more than \n2500 \nmm in hot arid zones. \nAttempts have been made experimentally to measure evapotranspiration by means \nof percolation \ngauges (Rodda, 1976) and, on a larger scale, by the use \nof lysimeters. However, no standard way of \nmeasuring it routinely has yet been devised. Indirect techniques therefore have to be relied on. \nPenman's formula (Penman, 1963) for predicting water surface evaporation is recognized as  the \nmost accurate \nof these indirect techniques. It is based on physical principies,  but involves the use \nof data which may not always be available e.g. measurements of radiation (or sunshine duration), \nwind run at 2 m   above ground, vapour pressure and air temperature, all \nof which should be taken at \nthe same site. \nAt altitudes above about 1000 m,   McCulloch's  fuller version of Penman's equation \n(McCulloch, 1965) should be used as  it makes express allowance for the corresponding pressure \ndrop and adjusts the radiation term for latitude. \nPenman also showed how  simple coefficients could be applied to  his open water evaporation \nfigures to  obtain the evapotranspiration rate from a grassed surface. The use \nof the latter became \nstandardized as  being the evapotranspiration (designated 'ETo') 'from  green grass surface cover \n80-150 mm high, actively growing'. Crop coefficients kc could then be applied to give the evapo-\ntranspiration \nof various types of crops at various stages of development and meteorological condi-\ntions, e.\ng. ET<cropl = kc.ETa. \nThornthwaite's formula for evapotranspiration from short vegetative cover, widely used in USA, \nis  empirical and  simpler than Penman's, being dependent on  sunshine hours and  mean monthly \ntemperature. Thornthwaite's method has been widely used, but it is strictly valid only for climates \nsimilar to that \nof eastern USA where the method was developed. The method tends to give evapora-\ntion estimates higher than those produced by  the Penman formula, particularly during the summer \nmonths. \nThe most recent guide to  assessing the irrigation requirements \nof growing crops is  the FAO's \nIrrigation and Drainage Paper 46, CROPWAT-A Computer Programfor Irrigation Planning and \nManagement, 1992. This computes evapotranspiration ETo values according to the Penman-Monteith \nmethod, to  which quoted crop coefficie nts, kc are then applied. An earlier FAO publication, \nIrriga-\ntion \nand Drainage Paper 24 ', Crop  water requirements, 1976, was based on the Blaney-Criddle \nformula, which uses temperature and length \nof daylight hours to give ETo values, which are then \nmodified by values given for a range \nof humidities and wind speeds. \nEvapotranspiration formulae assume no  shortage \nof water to  meet crop growth and potential \nevaporation. In dry periods when moisture availability becomes limiting, actual evapotranspiration \nis  less  than  the computed potential.

As  soil dries out and approaches wilting point \nevapotranspiration rates can drop to only about one-tenth \nof the potential. Sorne plants, such as pine \ntrees, are more successful than others in control \nof their water use in drought conditions. \nLosses do  not  always decrease at  cooler altitudes because advected wind energy and  higher \nradiation may offset the lower temperatures. Detailed measurements at experimental catchments by \nCEH have shown that losses increase with the density and height \nof natural vegetation growth and \ncrops, particularly in  mature coniferous forests. However, predicting forest annual loss compared \nwith that from grazed pasture is still not easy. \nIt has been shown that the forest loss is due to inter-\ncepted raindrops being evaporated back into the atmosphere at rates up to five  times normal transpi-\nration values for short grass. This is  because water laid out \nin thin films on vegetation can take up \navailable heat in the atmosphere more readily; the sight \nof a forest steaming gently in a short spell \nof sunshine between showers is  not uncommon. To quantify the extra loss to  be expected requires \n(Calder, 1992) an idea \nof the depth of water the canopy of vegetation can hold during a shower and \nthe frequency \nof showers. One point to note is that whilst rain is being evaporated off the outside \nof leaves, water is not transpired through them. As a result, perhaps only 90% of forest interception \nlosses are in addition to the catchment losses that would prevail anyway. \nA  review (Bosch, 1982) \nof 94 catchment experiments in  Africa, Asia, Australia and  North \nAmerica concluded that conifer forests could be expected to reduce catchment water yield, on aver-\nage, by 40 \nmm per 10% forest cover. More recent studies (Kirby, 1991), at Plynlimon in  the UK, \nfound that the magnitude \nof the reduction in  water yield was 29 mm per 10% forest cover, which \nequates to a \n15% reduction in the water yield for a completely forested upland catchment. It should \nbe noted, however, that while heavy afforestation \nof catchments reduces their overall water yield, \nthe results \nof the Plynlimon study and a study (Gustard, 1989) of catchment data from 40 European \nagencies found no  statistically significant relationship between the  proportion \nof forest cover and \nmeasures \nof low flow. These findings support the view that low flows in  upland headwater catch-\nments are  primarily influenced by  drainage from minor sources \nof groundwater, which remain \nlargely unaffected by forest interception losses. \n3.9 STREAMFLOW NATURALISATION \nIn most river basins, very few flow  regimes can be considered entirely natural, that is, free of arti-\nficial influences such as  abstractions, discharges or storage effects from impounding reservoirs. It \nis  therefore not usually sufficient to  evaluate a potential resource directly from the  'as-measured' \nstream flow  records. The need to  naturalize the available flow  records should be considered at the \nstart \nof any major water resource assessment. This involves considering the extent of artificial influ-\nences within a catchment, the  scale \nof their impact on  flows and  the purpose for  which the flow \nsequences are required. \nFlow naturalisation does not normally correct for anthropogenic effects such as  urbanisation \nor \nland  use changes. Except on  very  small catchments, these effects are not usually significant. The \nmain types \nof abstraction or artificial losses from a river system are public water supply abstrac-\ntions; irrigation and other abstractions for agriculture; power station cooling water

Elsewhere, review \nof abstraction licences/permits, where they exist, can often give an initial indication of the scale of \nabstractions, even though actual abstracted quantities will almost certainly be less than the licensed \ntotal. The type \nof abstraction is also relevant. Power stations are often licensed to abstract very large \nquantities \nof river water for cooling, although most of this water is returned to  the river a short dis-\ntance downstream. The net effect on river flow  is therefore small except immediately downstream \nof the abstraction. Similarly, large groundwater abstractions may be from parts of the aquifer not in \nhydraulic connection with the river and therefore have little or no effect on river flows. Sorne influ-\nences are seasonal so winter abstractions, in temperate climates for example, may have no effect on \nsummer low flows, although they could affect the refilling \nof storage. \nThe purpose \nof flow  naturalization should be clearly born in  mind and the parameters that are \ncritica! to the study in question should be assessed, for example water levels, mínimum flows or flow \nvolume o ver a critica! period. It may be considered, for example, that \nif gauged flows are within 10% \nof natural flows over the critica! period, then naturalisation is not necessary. \nIf naturalisation is required, the two most commonly used methods are naturalization by decom-\nposition and  rainfall-runoff modelling. Naturalisation by  decomposition involves breaking the \nobserved flow record down into its component parts. \nIf there are no reservoirs within the catchment \nthen the natural flow  is deduced by  quantifying ali the artificial components in  the observed \nflow \nrecord at the appropriate time step (daily or monthly) and using the following equation: \nNatural flow \n= gauged river flow + sum of all upstream abstractions - sum of all upstream \ndischarges and return flows to river \nThis process is critically dependent on the availability \nof good quality, complete data for both \nthe observed stream flows and for artificial influences (abstractions and return flows) upstream \nof \nthe location of interest. In  catchments where there are many small abstractions that individually \nhave little \norno impact on river flows, these may be filtered so that the smallest are either ignored or \ncombined. It may be adequate to consider only the main public water supply abstractions or sewage \ntreatment works discharges. These are usually the largest artificial influences and are often moni-\ntored so that specific time series data are available. \nFactors may be applied to certain types \nof abstraction to account for the proportion of abstracted \nwater that is  returned to  the river. \nIf time series data are not available, a  seasonal profile may be \napplied to  the mean annual abstraction where quantities vary  over the  year.

Impacts may  8 \nn 7 \n3.10 Long Term Average Catchment Run-off 77 \nbe time-lagged depending on the le ngth of the flow  path between river and groundwater table. The \nresults of regional groundwater models may help decide how best to allow for the effect of ground-\nwater abstractions in the naturalisation process. A  detailed discussion of these and other aspects is \ncontained in EA Guidelines (EA, 2001) and in Hall (1994). \nFor catchments that contain a reservoir, allowance needs to be made for the storage and attenu-\nation \nof flows and for additional evaporation losses from the reservoir surface, which can be sig-\nnificant in  warm semi-arid environments. \nIn order to  unravel storage effects, time series data are \nrequired for changes in reservoir leve! and/or storage, \ndrawoff to supply and spills/releases to the \nchannel downstream. \nIf data on reservoir spills are not available, the naturalisation can still be carried \nout on dry season flows, which are usually the most critica! from a water resources point of view. \nIf the available data are inadequate for a decomposition approach, it may be possible to gener-\nate natural flow \nsequences by means of rainfall-runoff modelling. Nevertheless, this approach still \nrequires data to represent rainfall \nand evaporation at an appropriate time scale over the catchment \nin question. Ideally, a brief period of observed (natural) river flows is  also required with which to \ncalibrate the model, although \nif this is  not available, sorne spot gaugings at low flow may suffice. \nOften, the available \ndata permits naturalisation by decomposition for the recent historie period with \nrainfall-runoff modelling required to extend flow \nsequences back to earlier years. \n3.1 O LONG TERM AVERAGE CATCHMENT RUN-OFF \nWherever possible, average catchment runoff should be calculated from a  long streamflow record, \nwhich, \nif subject to artificial influences, has been naturalized as described in Section 3.9. Where stream-\nflow records are either short term \nor non-existent, long te rm average runoff can be estimated by: \ncorrelating the brief records available for the study catchment with those of a long record sta-\ntion in a \ncatchment with similar characteristics; \ndeducting loss estimates from \ncatchment rainfall figures; \nuse \nof a rainfall/runoff model. \nCorrelations between long and short record stations are best carried out using monthly data. The \nuse of daily figures is more time consuming and often produces a large scatter while annual values \nprovide too few points. \nAn initial mathematical 'best fit' relationship between the stations may be \nderived by \ncomputer but a graphical plot should always be produced as a check on the mathematical \nfit. A manual adjustment should be made if, for example, the mathematically computed relationship \nis unduly influenced by  the values for a few  high flow  months, \nor if the relationship implies unreal \nintercept values. \nAn estímate \nof average runoff for a catchment for which no streamflow records exist is often \nobtained by deducting a value for average annual \ncatchment losses from the average annual catch-\nment rainfall for a  suitable standard period (e.g. 1961 to  1990). The latter can be obtained from \nan isohyetal \nmap of the region or from a GIS-based gridded database such as the FEH CD-ROM \n(NERC, 2006) (Section 3.5). If possible, the value for average annual catchment losses should be \nbased \non the typical average annual loss  value obtained from similar gauged catchments in  the \nregion. \nHowever, if no such data exist, estimates of actual evapotranspiration can provide a reason-\nable measure \nof catchment losses as  long as  there are no  significant abstractions or groundwater \noutflows from the catchment. In the UK, the Meteorological Office publishes estimates of actual \nevapotranspiration for a \nnetwork of grid squares covering the whole country from its

It actual evaporat1on data are not ava1lable, \nvalues can be estimated from catchment average annual potential evapotranspiration (Smith, \n1975) \nmultiplied by the adjustment factors listed in Table 3.3. \nFor most regions, rainfall stations are   more numerous and  have  longer records than stream-\nflow measurement stations. Rainfall/runoff models su ch as \nHYSIM (Manley, 1978) or HEC-RAS \n(USACE, 2000) are therefore commonly  used to extend short term stream flow records. Typically, \na chosen model is \ncalibrated by adjusting the model parameters so as  to  produce the best possible \nmatch between predicted and measured flows. \nThe calibrated model is then used to extend the short \nterm stream flow data to cover the longer period \nof rainfall records. One of the usual checks on  the \nsynthetic stream flow data gen\nerated  by rainfall/runoff models is whether they accurately reproduce \nthe long term mean runoff estimated by other means, particularly \novera standard period. \n3.11 MINIMUM RAINFALLS \nExperience of past recorded droughts and low rainfall is an important factor in  assessing probable \nfuture conditions that may be encountered. In the variable  climate \nof the UK the longest known spell \nwithout any recorded rain at ali (Ho  lford, \n1977) was for 73 days from 4 March 1893 at Mile End in \nLondon. \nAt the other extreme, in desert climates many years may have no rainfall at ali. At Calama, \nwhich is in the Atacama desert \nof northem Chile, it is  believed that virtually no rain fell  for 400 \nyears until a sudden storm in 1972. \nThe most notable droughts in England and Wales in the l ast 100 years were the following: \n1921 Southeast England. Annual rainfall lowest in over 100 years; spring sources hard hit \nas the autumn rainfall was insufficient to prevent flow recession, which began in a \ndry spring and continued until January \n1922 in  many parts; \n1933-34 Wales and mid-England.  Two dry  summers with a  remarkably dry  winter \nintervening; \n1943-44 Southern England. A  similar pattern to 1933-34; very low  flows experienced in \nspring-fed rivers because preceding years were al so dryish; \n1949 Exceptionally low summer rainfall and high temperatures affected sources reliant \non river flows or with little storage; \n1959 Similar to 1949; \n1975-76 \nMany low flow records broken because of low summer rainfall; \n1988-92 South and East England. A succession of dry winters taxed groundwater supplies; \nrunoff deficits in parts \nof east England were  the largest for 150 years; \n1995-96 Pennines.

Hence, when estimating the \nmínimum yield \nof a source it is necessary to bear in mind the types of drought that past  experience \nshows are possible. \nAn estímate \nof drought raínfall for catchment modelling can be made either by using a knowl-\nedge \nof recorded mínimum rainfall for a region, expressed as  a percentage of the average, or by \ncarrying out a statistical analysis (Tabony, 1977) \nof available rainfall measurements. \n3.12 MINIMUM RATES OF RUN-OFF \nIn temperate climates with variable rainfall, when mínimum runoffs are expressed as rates per unit \ncatchment area, it can often be seen that catchment geology and topography are the major influ-\nences, except where human activity has interfered. Clearly the  dry  weather flow \nof many small \ncatchments is zero; and bournes, which are streams flowing strongly when the water table is  high, \ndry out gradually from their headwaters as the water table leve! falls away from the stream bed. In \ntemperate zones where rainfall occurs throughout the year, large rivers do not dry up. \nSevera! studies have attempted to  predict mínimum flows \nof specified severity after regional \nanalysis \nof flow records. Notable examples include those for:  Malaysia (Enex, 1976),  Europe \n(Gustard, 1989), New York State (Darmer, 1970) and that produced in  1992 by the IoH, now the \nCentre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) for the \nUK (Gustard, 1992). The loH provided formulae \nfor estimating drought flows based on a detailed classification \nof 29 types of soil systems. A sum-\nmary national equation for UK, which accounted for 62% \nof the variations encountered, is: \n1 day mean flow exceeded 95% \nof the time, Q\n9\ns(t) = 44B\n143 \ns\n0033 \nAºº\n34 \nwhere Q\n9\ns( t) is  the  1 day flow, expressed as  a percentage of the  long-term average daily flow, B is \nthe Base Flow Index (BFI) (Table  3.4); \nSis the Standard Average Annual Rainfall 1941-70 in mm; \nA is the catchment area in km\n2\n• \nMean annual 7-day mínimum flow, MAM(7) = 6.40 Q\n950\n?\n953 \ns-\n00342 \nwhere MAM(7) is expressed as a percentage of the long-term average daily flow. \nThe BFI represents  the proportion \nof river flow, which it is  estimated to be derived from under-\nground storage. IoH developed a procedure for evaluating BFI from an analysis \nof a long sequence \nof da ily flows by locating the mínima of consecutive non-overlapping 5-day flow totals. The analysis \nthen searches for the 'tuming points' in the sequence \nof mínima, connecting them together to form the \nestimated baseflow hydrograph. Fig  ure 3.2    shows a graphical representation \nofthe procedure. The BFI \nis the volume \nof flow below the baseflow hydrograph, divided by the total flow for the same period. \nThe BFI values for over 1300 gauged catchments \nin UK are given in the latest issue of the CEH/ \nBritish Geological Survey publication \nHydrological Data UK: Hy drometric Register and Statistics. \nFor any ungauged catchment an estímate of the BFI can be obtained either by interpolation between the \nvalues for upstream and downstream gauging stations, quoted in the H ydrometric Register for the same \nriver, \nor by transposing the value for a gauged catchment with a similar average annual rainfall, surface \ngeology and soil type. The approach has been adopted by a number \nof countries for analysis of their \nriver low flow\ns, the advantage being that annual values of BFI tend to be  more stable than other low \nflow  variables.

The sys-\ntem includes extens ive data on artificial influences to enable these to be taken into account but, \nbecause \nof the size and complexity of the software, it is  not generally available to  the average \npractitioner. \n3.13 MAXIMUM RAINFALLS \nFigure 3.3 is a plot of the maximum measured rainfalls recorded at individual points in the world. It \nmust be stressed that the highest  falls are precipitated only in the most unusual    hill areas in certain \nclimatic zones, once the duration exceeds one day. In addition, the lines do not represent any contin-\nuous event, except possibly for a storm lasting for up to, say, four hours.  The maximum figures for \nBritain are seen to be about \n20-30% of world maxima, with the lowland easterly part of the country \nsu ffering less  severely in  long duration storms. The greatest is  the Martinstown,  Dorset, storm \nof \n1955 in which 280 mm (11  in) ofrain were officially noted in 18.5  hours, with an unofficial  estímate \nat the heart \nof the storm claiming 350 mm (14 in). \nMaximum rainfalls  vary with the  season \nof the  year because  thunderstorm intensities are \nassociated with high sea and air temperatures. However, high rainfalls \novera day or so may occur at \nany   time \nof year, whenever the weather system can bring in moist air steadily and where conditions \n(often orographic) exist to cause precipitation. \n2000 \n1000 \n800 \n600 \n400 \n200 \nfil \n100 \n,:: \n80 \nI \n60 \n-¡¡¡ 40 \n'l: \n·¡¡¡ \na: \n20 \n10 \n8 \n6 \n4 \n2 \n-\n_..V \nt? \nV,• \n-\n--\n1 \nb' \n1 \n/ \nr,-1 \n1/f'/ \n1 \nWor1d maximum ¡--._ \n7 1\n,..,,, \n-!:;:, Chenapun¡I. \n/ \nl_.----\n1ndi\nª Spnnkh~Tam \n1 \n1 \n_Av· ·: \nA 1954 \nv i \n1 \n/ -:7'f-Glenqoo1ch-\n-\nC1laos.

{"id":"cmkjtrz56000tv5q818ar9y2i","content":"Maximum recorded world  and  British  rainfall.  2 \nn 8 \nIt is quite possible for many years to elapse without any outstanding maximum rainfall event and \nthen for severa) unusual maximums to be clustered close together, probably due to high concurrent \nsea temperatures and dominant weather system movement routes. Many countries have compila-\ntions \nof extreme meteorological events and these should not be overlooked. Many national metereo-\nlogical agencies make available long period rainfall measurements and duration-intensity-frequency \nestimates. These are often adequate for  estimating storm magnitudes that can  be expected more \nfrequently than once every 50 years; but possible rarer storms need to be investigated by thorough \nregional studies. \nIn the UK the most up-date information is contained in Volume 2 ofthe Flood Esti-\nmation Handbook (FEH, 1999) and shows how rainfall frequency calculations can be applied to \nUK \ncatchments, leading to estimation of either the rainfall depth for a given return period and duration, \nor of the return period corresponding to a given depth and duration of rainfall. The parameters of the \nrainfall frequency model are provided digitally on \nFEH CD-ROM to a 1  km grid. \nImprovcd rainfall depth-duration-frequcncy valucs for use \nin UK flood studics should bccome \navailable from the Defra project \"WS194/2/29, Reservoir Safety-Long Return Period Rainfall\n\", \ndue for completion in late 2008. A project report by Svensson (2006) provides a review of rainfall \nfrequency and  probable maximum precipitation estimation methods, both in  the \nUK and  severa] \nother countries. \n3.14 MAXIMUM RUN-OFFS \nPeak flood dischargcs are notoriously difficult to mcasurc directly bccausc of thcir transicnt naturc, \nhigh vclocity, la  rgc dcbris contcnt and  thc difficulty \nin gaining acccss to thc rivcr during times of \nflood. Thc problcm is exaccrbated whcn flows come out of bank and significant discharge occurs \nacross thc  flood plain. Peak discharges can, howcvcr, oftcn be  est\nimatcd  indircctly by mcans of \nhydraulic calculations using scdiment or debris marks lcft bchind by the flood to indicatc peak water \nleve], cross section area and water surface slope. \nFigure 3.4 gives sorne recorded maximum runoff data experienced in UK. In lowland areas, peak \nrunoff rates are normally much lower than Figure 3.4 suggests because \nof the temporary storage \navailable \nin side channels  and drains or in adjacent low Iying land and the greater Iikelihood of drier \nsoil conditions before a storm. For example \nin the fenland area of eastern England entire catchments \nmay be drained quite adequately by pumping stations capable \nof pumping no more than 13 mm of \nrunoff from their catchment per day.  This is  very much less than the maximum precipitation rates \nshown in Figure 3.3 where rainfalls up to about 250 mm \nin 24 hours can occur in Eastern England, \nas  shown \nby the plot for  Thanct. Thcsc figures are  not howcvcr, l argc compared with cxpericncc \nelsewhere in the world where ten times higher rates can be experienced. \nThcre are four mcthods \nof cstimating maximum runoffs; the fourth applics spccifically to thc UK. \nl. Probability analysis of existingflood records. This method plots recorded peak floods against \na probability distribution, as described for the analysis \nof droughts in Sections 3.18 and 3.19, \nin order to  estímate the  probability of occurrence of a flood of given magnitude. The type \nof probability distribution used is  that which gives a best straight Iine plot for the recorded \nfloods. Usually the peak flood for each year \nof record (the AMAX series) is plotted; but sorne-\ntimes ali peak flows above a given leve) are plotted (a peaks-over-a-threshold analysis). \nIn the \nlatter

Thus, a  30-year record of annual maximum floods \ncannot be safely used \nto estimate the magnitude of a 100 year return period flood. In addition, \nthe  accuracy \nof past flood records cannot be  checked and  catchment conditions may  have \naltered since records were taken or may alt\ner in the future. \n2. \nUse of regional jlood probability curves. A different approach, applicable worldwide, is to \nuse  'regional flood probability curves' which are published for  many regions (Fig. 3.5).    The \nmean annual flood for a given catchment, termed 'the index flood', is obtained from the period \nof historie record. A  'growth factor' (i.e.  multiplier) taken from the appropriate regional flood \nprobability cur\nve is then applied to the index flood to give the probable magnitude of a flood \nof given return period T. Published flood probability curves are  derived  from analyses of \nflood magnitude frequencies for catchments in the same region possessing similar character-\nistics. \nIn the absence of an adequate historie record, the mean annual flood may be estimated \nusing formulae based on regression analyses with various catchment characteristics such as \ncatchment area, average annual rainfall, soil type or average catchment slope. \nIn the UK, the  latest approach is to adopt the median annual flood as  the  'index flood', \nrather than  the mean. The FEH (1999) also introduces the concept \nof a  'pooling group' of \ncatchments  with  similar characteristics to  replace geographical regions. Full details of the \nmethod are gi ven in the Volume 3 \nof the handbook. \n3. Flood estimation derived from maximum precipitation.

The method is of wide application   because use \nof the unit hydrograph permits the calculation of flood flows from a wide range ofrainstorms. \nBoth approaches are similar but as the second  is  principally u sed for desig ning impounding \nrese\nrvoir overflows, it is d  escribed in Chapter 5, Section  5.6. \n4.

Alternative me  thods are presented \nfor flood frequency est\nimation on any catchment, gauged or  ungauged.

The rainfall-runoff method uses Vo lume 2 procedures for estimating de   pth and \nduration \nof rainfall for a gi  ven re  turn pe riod, or vice versa. This permits the estimation of \nfloods  for return periods between 2 a   nd 10 000 years a  nd derivation of the probable maxi-\nmum \nflood from estimates of the probable maximum precipitation.

Issues identified with \nthe \nFEH are mentioned in Section 5. 17. \nPART II YIELD OF SURFACE SOURCES \n3.15 INTRODUCTION, DEFINITIONS ANO CONCEPTS \nThe term 'yield'  does not have a precise meaning. Its  definition varíes according to  the  context, \nwhich is  important to understand when interpreting yield values quoted by  others. Similarly, it is \nessential to state cl early the basis \nof yield calculations when quoting a yield figure to others. \nThe fo\nllowing terms are used to define yield more precisely orto indicate the way in which yield \nhas been calculated: \nhydrological yield \nsource yield \naverage yield \nprobability yield \noperational yield \nsystem yield \nhistorie yield \nfailure yield \nTerms such as  'deployable output' \nor 'water available for use' (WAFU) are sometimes under-\nstood to be general yield terms whereas in fact they have precise meanings in legal or regulatory \ncontexts. The meaning \nof ali of these terms is discussed in the following paragraphs while examples \nof their use are given later in the chapter. \nU nderstanding the difference between terms in the first two rows \nof the abo ve list is fundamental \nto  appreciating the  subtleties \nin more precise definitions. For surface water sources, hy drological \nyield is limited by  the overall availability of rainfall and river flow, perhaps boosted by  storage to \niron out short-term shortages. However, the water available  to satisfy demand may be less than that \navailable in  purely hydrological terms. It may be limited by  hydraulic constraints su ch as  pump, \nintake \nor pipe capacity or by the terms of an abstraction licence or agreement. Hydraulic yield so \nconstrained is referred to as \noperational yield. In 1996, the UK Government published its Agenda \nfor Action which introduced a new framework for the assessment of water resources in the newly \nprivatized \nUK water industry. The paper assigned fairly precise definitions within the regulatory \nframework to terms like \ndeployable output and water available for use. Their relationship to other \nterms like 'hydrological yield' is illustrated in Plate l(a). \nDeployable output (DO) is  the  constant rate of supply that can be  maintained from a  water \nresources system except during periods \nof restriction. DO may be  constrained by  the  specified \n'Leve! \nof Service'(LoS); the historie period for which data are available; the physical capacity of \nthe supply system (pipes, pumps, intakes etc.); abstraction licences or permits; and water quality and \nenvironmental constraints \n(UKWIR/EA, 2000). \nFrom the above, it can be seen that quoting a \nDO figure without defining the constraints under \nwhich it was calculated is usually rather meaningless. Levels \nof service are discussed below under \n'source reliability' while other constraints are discussed in sections 3.18 to 3. 24 in relation to specific \ntypes \nof

{"id":"cmkjtrz56000xv5q8o4ngq6ko","content":"3. 24 in relation to specific \ntypes \nof sources.  6 \nThe supply figure that  must be  relied on is Water  Available for Use (WAFU). This can  be \ncomprornised by Outage, which \nis the temporary loss of DO dueto planned events, such as mainte-\nnance \nof source works, or unplanned events such as power failure, system failure and unacceptably \nhigh levels \nof pollution; turbidity, nitrates and algae. Outage must therefore be added to WAFU to \ngetDO. \nMore often than not, the yield quoted for a source is its drought yield; the amount of water the \nsource can produce in  times \nof drought. However, for much of the  time the source can provide \nmore than this. When water is plentiful, higher rates \nof output can support higher rates of demand \nor may enable other sources to be rested. As  rainfall and river flows decrease in dry periods, output \nis reduced to ensure that supplies can be maintained throughout a period \nof drought. The long-term \noutput \nof the source through wet and dry periods is called the average yield. This is a good indicator \nof source potential and its overall contribution to  satisfying demand. However, drought yields are \nthe figures most often quoted since they can be relied on most \nof the time. \nDroughts vary enormously in their severity and duration so when quoting a drought yield, the \ndrought parameters must be defined. Drought severity can be considered in terms \nof the quantity of \nrainfall or runoff that occurs in a given period and the frequency with which this happens. The defi-\nnition \nof yield that incorporates this combination of quantity and frequency is called the probability \nyield; \nthe source output that can be maintained throughout a drought of given severity or frequency. \nIn sparsely populated or remote areas with scattered communities, a  single water supply source \nis often adequate to supply the needs \nof the local population. The yield of this source is referred to \nas \nsource yield. As the population grows and communities merge into towns and conurbations, these \nsingle sources are often connected by distribution systems so that any one community may \nbe served \nby more than one source. The yield \nof these linked systems is termed system yield. \nLinked systems can also realise benefits from the conjunctive use of different types of sources. \nMost surface water sources face a reduction in water availability in the summer or dry season. The \nearly  summer is  a time when groundwater storage is  normally at its maximum following winter \nrecharge. The linking \nof these different types of source may increase security of supply by taking \nadvantage \nof their differing yield characteristics. This introduces the concept of critica! drought \nperiod. \nIn essence, the yield of any source is defined by: \ninflow over the critic\na] period + any storage that is available \nYield \n= -----------------------\nLength of the critica! period \n(3.1) \nAt a run-of-river intake, there may be no storage available to buffer brief periods of rninimum \nflow. The critica! period in this case would be zero and yield \nis effectively the mínimum river flow \nof specified frequency. Impounding reservoirs provide storage, which can maintain supplies above \nthe rate \nof mínimum flow for a certain period. How long this period is depends on how much storage \nis available and how long flows remain below the target rate of drawoff; i.e. drought duration (Plate \n1B and Section 3.19). \nThe period over which available storage is drawn down is critica! to deterrnining the size of the \nyield, hence \ncritica! period. The concept of critica! drought period is  fundamental to  both yield \nassessment and water supply  system design.

This is one of the \nmain reasons why  yield assessments in the  UK are  generally required to use system  simulation \nmodelling (Section 3.24). \nAli  water utility managers have to be  aware that almost every source has a quantifiable risk of \npartial failure. However, source reliability can be viewed from two perspectives: \nclimatic or hydrological variability; \nthe capacity or constraints of the water supply system. \nThe method used to quantify yield depends on which of these perspectives is the focus of concem. \nHydrological parameters such as rainfall and river flow have a natural variability and ultimately \ntheir availability will limit the yield attainable. Individual sources may be developed \nto abstract ali \nof the water available in times of drought. Their output is therefore related closely to  hydrological \nvariability and attempts are made to describe this variability by comparing it to a statistical or prob-\nability distribution (Section 3.18). \nIn regions where water is relatively plentiful and living standards are high, supply systems are \ndeveloped in stages in response to the growing demand of the population and the needs of the envi-\nronment. As demand rises, the capacity of source works is increased or new sources are developed \nto satisfy that demand for a given leve) of reliability. The required reliability may be specified by a \ncentral planning authority as one of the criteria in system design. In a privatized water industry, a \nreliability standard may be set or imposed by regulation, the standard being determined by a com-\nbination of cost, customer preference and  environmental implications. Typically, such a standard \nwould be one of a number of levels of service to  which the utility managed its  supply. Relevant \ntypical levels of service that have been used in the UK are: \na hosepipe ban not more than once in 10 years on average; \na need for a major public campaign requesting voluntary savings of water not more than once \nin 20 years on average; \nDrought Orders imposing restrictions on non-essential use not more frequently than one year \nin 50 on average; \nDrought Orders authorising standpipes or rota cuts not more frequently than one year in 100 \non average. \nSuch levels \nof service are  not  statutory requirements but  are in essence a  contract between \ncustomer and  supplier setting out the  standards of service that customers can expect to receive. \nReliability involves a balance between the needs of customers and the needs of the environment and \nas such, it may change with time. This affects the deployable output of the system. If DO is set too \nhigh, cut-backs in supply will be too frequent and the levels of service will not be met; the DO then \nhas to be reduced until the levels of service are achieved. \nHydrological yield is  usually calculated on the assumption of drawoff to supply at a constant \ntarget rate. However, it has always been recognized that water supply sources are not operated in an \n\"on/off' way. If the target rate cannot be  maintained, a  lesser rate almost certainly can. In reality, \nwater resources managers do not wait until supplies are about to run out before initiating cut-backs. \nSystem operation rules normally specify that target drawoffs are reduced when reservoir storage or \nriver flows fall  below pre-defined thresholds.

These y  ields normally referred to single s   ources or sma  ll \ngroups \nof sources. \nIn the la te  1960s and  1970s there was a  change towards probability yie lds b ased on statistical \nanalyses \nof historie drought flow  sequences. These anal   yses allowed synthetic flow  sequen ces to be \nconstructed to represent droughts \nof varying duration, severity or re tum period. \nAs   individual  s  ources incr easingly  became  merged  into  linked  systems for  which  complex \nope  rating rules were some times devised,  the yie  ld \nof individual  sources became l   ess rel evant and \nthe difficulty of calculating yie   ld for such systems became more apparent.  In 1995-96 there was a \nnota\nble drought across  much of the co  untry and the S ecretary of State   for the Envi ronment initi-\nated a r\neview of the l essons to be learned  for water resources and supply a  rrangeme  nts,  both for \nthe ongo\ning drought and for the longer te rm. The G  overnment consulted  widely amongst inter-\nested parties and the r esults of the review were published in a paper e  ntitled Water Resources and \nSupply: A  gendafor Action (DoE, 1996). Annex E of the paper outlines the framework in which  the \nyie  ld of s  urface water sources for public water s  upply are to be assessed \nin the UK on a consistent \nbasi\ns. \nThe framework embodies two main principals: \nyie ld is to be assessed by simula\ntion  of the r ealistic operation of the water resources system in \nquestion; a   nd \nyie  ld  is de\nfined as the s upply that c  an be met with a given l eve! of   servi  ce. \nEffec\ntively, this  m  eans that  a  computer  s  imulation  model  of the  water  r   esources  system  is \nre quired  (  Section 3.24\n). However,  not ali water supply  sources  occur in integrated water supply \nsystem\ns, pa rticularly in sparsely  populated  or develo ping  co   untries. Differe  nt  source typ es  have \ndiffere  nt cha  racte\nristics and he nce methods of estimating their yie ld vary. \n3.17 METHODS OF YIELD ESTIMATION-GENERAL \nEquation (3.1) describes  the  basic  yield calculation for ali single  s   ources. Any yield assessment \nrelies on historical data sufficie nt for the purpose. How  ever,  it must be accepted that available data \nare   unlikely to revea! a  drought \nthat would be c  ritica! to yield  dete  rminations. In arid or  semi-arid \nregions, \nrivers  frequently dry up  altogether  for at l   east p art of the year. Without storage, the  'his-\nto rie yie\nld' of such streams is zero. However, they may  not   dry up every  year and so  sorne water \nis  ava\nilable in ce rtain years. The more water  that is required, the lower the frequen cy at which  it is \nava\nilable.  This combination of quantity a nd frequency is   called the proba bility yield. \n3.18 RIVER INTAKE YIELDS \nBy  far the m ost reliable estímate of river  intake yield is o  btained by analysing a long, reliable r ecord \nof \nriver flows at or near the po  int of abstraction.

This is   likely to be  true \nif the flow  variability is   natural but it is  very \nunlikely   to be  true \nif the record contains artificial influences.

This is  likely to be a much more stable \nvalue than daily flow, which can be subject to erratic changes \ndueto gate operation or other artificial \ninfluen ces upstream. The shorter the critica! period,   the more important it is  to base the analysis on \nda ily flow\ns. If only monthly data are available for the location in question, a scaling factor sho  uld \nbe applied to the monthly values to reduce them to the relevant short\ner pe riod. An appropriate fac-\ntor can be  obtained from an analysis \nof daily low flow  sequences from a flow record on a similar  or \nnearby river in the region. \nThe above discussion relates to the deterrnination \nof the hydrological yield of a river intake \ni.e.  water availability is  limited only by climatic variability and hydrologi\ncal factors. In reality, \nthe  yield \nof river intakes  may be constrained by  a number of additional factors including the \nfollowing: \nLicence or permit constraints: abstraction limits linked  to river flow\ns; compensation flows or \nenvironmental  sweetening flows; and the rights \nof other users; \nHydraulic capacity \nof the intake; \nWater quality constraints: tidal  effects and saline intrusion; pollution etc. \nIn modern UK parlanc\ne, this constrained figure tends to be referred to as the 'de  ployable output' \nof a source. \nIf the hydrological yie ld of the river is greater than the physical capacity of the intake and any \npumps involved, these would constrain source yield. Such factors could be inherent in the design or \nhave resulted from post-construction morphological changes in the river channel (erosion, deposi-\ntion \nor changes in river course). \nMany river intakes are located near the tidal lirnit \nof rivers in order to be able to exploit the maxi-\nmum potential hydrological yield \nof the catchment. Even where water levels at the intake exhibit \ntidal influence (e.g. a twice-daily cycle) the water itself may remain fresh in all but the most extreme \ncircumstances. These us ually occur when extreme high tides coincide with low river flows allowing \nsaline water to intrude further up the estuary than normal and perhaps reach the intake. The saline \nwater (intrusion) travels up the estuary as  a wedge \n(dueto its  greater density) with freshwater on \ntop. The depth from which water is drawn into the intake may therefore determine the increase in \nsalinity. The frequency \nof such an event determines whether it affects yield. Rare events are likely to \nbe treated as \nsource outages, in which case they would have no effect on quoted yields or deployable \noutput. Frequent events may mean that for high levels \nof reliability (low probability of failure) the \nsource has no reliable yield at all. This situation rnight arise due to continuing increases in upstream \nabstractions. \nWater quality problems at intakes are not restricted to saline intrusion. A  serious pollution inci-\ndent in the river upstream could cause the intake to be closed for a time. As mentioned earlier, sorne \nintakes have a bankside storage provision to provide supplies during the period \nof closure. As with \nsaline intrusion, intake yields may become affected \nif the water quality problems become more fre-\nquent \nor protracted. Background levels of pollution by chernicals such as nitrates (from fertilizers) \nare one example.  High nitrate levels are often associated with the first  period \nof significant runoff \nafter a long dry spell when nitrate build-up in the soil is  washed into rivers. It may \nbe possible to \nmodel this effect using long sequences \nofriver flow record if the relationship between nitrates, flows \nand dry periods can be adequately defined.

It is the period over which storage is used to supplement \nriver flows to rnaintain a reliable yield, the larger the available storage, the longer the critica! period. \nThe other rnain factors determining yield are the le ngth of the dry season, over which flows have to be \nboosted, and the volurne of reservoir inflows during this period. If winter rains are regular and the reser-\nvoir fills every year, the critica! period is sh ort, pe rhaps 6-1 O months. \nIf the storage is small, it rnay be \neven shorter. \nIf winter rains occasionally fail,  droughts may extend over 2 years or even longer. In this \ncase, storage has to \nbe eked out over a longer period making the critica! period longer. Plate lB illus-\ntrates the principies involved. \nThe volurne of water that supports yield is A (the  volurne of inflow over \nthe period) plus B (  the volume \nof storage used to rnaintain the required supply over the sarne period). So \nif the volume is X million litres and the critica! period is Y   days the reservoir yield is X/Y = V M  l/d. \nThe historie yield is calculated by identifying the longest period in the historie period that has \nthe  srnallest volurne \nof inflow  (per unit of time). To gel a  robust yield figure you  need the lo n-\ngest period of record you can in order to ensure it contains a severe drought that is unlikely to be \nexceeded often. This rnay require the reservoir inflow record to be extended back in  time (by flow \ncorrelation \nor rainfall/runoff modelling) if the direct record is not long enough.

The  chances \nof finding one are slight so a  'synthetic drought' is  sometimes constructed from available runoff \nrecords. For the design \nof a new reservoir, many of the variables such as storage volume, compensa-\ntion flow etc. may be undecided \nanda number of options may need to be assessed. Each option may \nhave a different critica! period. It is  very unlikely that data will be available for a historie drought \nfor which all the critica! periods \nof interest have the same return period. One way of getting round \nthis is  to construct a nested synthetic drought in  which runoff \nof all durations has the same return \nperiod so that, \nin saya 36 month sequence of river flows, the   driest 6, 7, 8, 15, 18, 24, etc. periods \nali have the same probability \nof recurrence; say 2% (1 in 50 years). An illustration of this if sh own \nin  Figure 3.8. Another graphical method, illustrated in  Fig  ure 3.9, is \nto express the minimum yield \nas a proportion of the mean catchment flow  over the period of record and the reservoir storage as a \nproportion \nof the mean annual flow volume. \nMost \nof the commercial software available to simulate complex water resources systems sum-\nmarized in  Sec\ntion 3.   24 can also be used to  simulate individual reservoirs. Alternatively, a  spread-\nsheet may be used with parameters su ch as inflow, storage, outflow etc. arranged \nin columns across \nthe page and values for each time step arranged in rows down the page. The el evation/storage and/or \nel evation/surface area relationships \n(Section 5.18) can be represented as lookup tables.

There are no \nhydraulic considerations involved. \nEvaporation from the surface \nof a water body, such as a reservoir, is greater than from the equiva-\nlent  area \nof land  surface. Potential evaporation is higher because  the  albedo (reflectivity) of the \nreservoir surface is  lower and more \nof the sun's energy is available to drive evaporation. However, \nthe ratio \nof actual to  potential evaporation is  also  higher because of the  availability of water to \nevaporate. In temperate regions, the increased losses from the surface \nof the reservoir may not be \nsignificant, especially \nin the case of a relatively small reservoir in  a lar   ge catchment. However, in \narid or semi-arid zones, such losses can be very large and should be allowed for in the yield calcula-\ntion. \nIn the simplest calculations, daily or monthly evaporation figures can be applied to the average \nsurface area \nof the reservoir. However, if a spreadsheet model is  used, it is  straightforward to apply \nevaporation figures to the area \nof the reservoir at  each time step, computed using a storage/elevation/ \narea

The use \nof mean monthly flows is inexact and necessitates reducing the computed yield by \nan arbitrary amount to allow for part of the flows in excess of the mean being uncollectable. If sorne \ndaily flow records are  available, these may  assist \nin estimating what allowance should  be  made; \notherwise a frequent practice \nis to assume that only 90% of the potential abstraction is possible. The \nbetter option \nis to  develop a series of daily flows that represent flows during a period of minimum \nrunoff. The method involves use of minimum monthly flows of a suitable probability (say 2%)    and \napplying to  them a factor derived from a relevant, albeit short, record \nof daily flow  for one of the \nmonths. \nWith daily flows available, the basic calculations are as shown \nin Ta ble 3.5.  However, the sub-\ncalculation required to calculate potential abstraction depends on:  (a) the rule(s) laying down the \nabstraction conditions; (b) the assumed maximum pumping capacity; and (c) the time lag between a \nchange \nof flow and the consequent change of pumping rate. \nFactors (b) and (c)  need careful consideration before starting the calculation. With appropriate \ncontrol equipment and variable speed pumps, the abstraction may closely follow flow  variations; \nbut other arrangements are often adopted. A range \nof fixed speed pumps may be started and stopped \nautomatically to give outputs such as 0.5Q, l.OQ, l.5Q or 2.0Q according to their combination. In \naddition, if pump output is manually controlled, the time lag between change of flow  and change \nof abstraction will  depend on  the manning pattern and on  whether variable or fixed speed pumps \nare used. \nA  simplistic calculation can  be based on  assuming an  unlimited volume \nof reservoir storage \nis available so  the  maximum drawdowns occurring each year can  be calculated and  plotted on \nprobability paper to  find  the  drawdown probable once \nin, say,  50 years. However, this  does not \nsolve the problem \nof what yield is available with a reservoir of a lesser capacity than the maximum \ndrawdown. Calculations then  have to  proceed for a range \nof drawoffs to  produce a yield-storage \nTable 3.5 Pumped storage reservoir calculation in 10\n3 \nm\n3\n/day (Abstraction condition-two-thirds flow

This process is difficult to carry through successfully unless the flow  record \nis  long enough to  make the probabi!ity plot one for interpretation only. Points from an  unnatural \ndistribution do not permit confident extrapolation. \nIn view of th ese difficulties, it is more satisfactory to work directly on an estímate of the   daily \nflows likely during, say,  a drought of 2% risk. It is  then  possible to  compute the yield of 2% risk \naccording  to  the size \nof storage reservoir adopted and the three factors mentioned above. A further \nlirniting consideration is  the need to ensure refilling \nof the reservoir after sorne maximum drawdown. \nThe most secure provision \nis to ensure refilling of the   reservoir in any single  wet season following a \ndry season,  but this is  not always possible. So\nrne pumped storage schernes accept that refilling will \nonly occur once every few years, but they should be tested to make sure they can achieve an initial \nfilling sufficient to meet the anticipated initial demand. \nA\nli such problems can be dealt with by applying appropriate computer calculations to the record \nof daily flows. Arnong the  most u  seful result is   that of finding the  most  econornic s  ize of purnps \nto insta\nll. Increasing pump capacity beyond a certain l eve) may increase the yield  by  only a   small \namount when flows fall rapidly and critica) drawdown periods are short. On the other hand, the need \nto  ens  ure  refilling \nof the reservoir  during a wet period may  be  an  over-riding factor determining \nmaximum pumping capacity. \n3.21 YIELD OF REGULATING RESERVOIRS \nA regulating reservoir (Fig.  3.10) impounds water from a catchment A, and releases water to sup-\nport an  abstraction at so\nrne l ocation B downstream, when flows at B are not sufficient to meet the \nrequired abstractio\nn. This means that the yie ld obtainable is   greater than that provided by  catchment \nA  alone. Usua\nlly sorne  compensation water has to  be  rel eased from A  to  maintain a flow in the \nstream below it; a nd at B va\nrious   abstraction conditions may apply in order to  preserve the natural \nlow flow  regime \nof the river. This may re quire e ither: \nma  int\nen ance of a gi  ven flow continuously below the intake B; or \nabstraction at B to be fully supported by equi\nvalent releases from A until the natural flow at B

The proportion \nof \nthis flow  diverted into the regulating reservoir A has to be assessed and probably bears a varying \nrelationship \nto the natural flow at B. The calculation can then  proceed according to  the rules laid \ndown for compensation releases at A and the abstraction conditions at \nB. An example is  given in \nTable 3.6. \nTwo points need to \nbe borne in  mind. Releases from the reservoir may need to  include an \nallowance for  evapotranspiration and  other losses en  route to  the  abstraction site (hence the \n10% addition to Col. 4 in  Col.  5 \nof Table 3.6). Secondly, the  time taken for released water to \ntravel to the abstraction point must be taken into account. Depending on the distance involved, \nthe time lag may range from severa! hours to \n1 or 2 days or more. This can mean that an increase \nof re lease in  expectation that flow  at the intake will decline may be  wasted if rain should come \nand  increase  the  flow. He   nce,  a   furth\ner allowance of 10%  or 15%  may  have  to  be  added to \nthe releases to  cover discrepancies between actual and theoretical release requirement\ns. A dry \nweather recession curve for the natural flow  at the intake, converted into a guiding rule, can be \nused to  aid release decisions. Use \nof such a decision rule in UK has s hown that actual releases \ntend to \nbe up to 20% more than the theoretical requirement in wet years and about 3%  more in \ndry years. \nTable 3.6 Regulating reservoir calc ulations.

The yield of the catchwater is the \namount \nof water the catchwater can provide with specified frequency or reliability over a given \nperiod. This period would normally be the critica! drawdown period \nof the reservoir so catchwater \nyield is effectively the amount by which the catchwater raises the yield \nof the reservoir. \nIt is  very unusual for flows in catchwaters to  be measured directly. The contribution made by \nthe catchwater therefore has to be estimated. Unless it is extremely large, the catchwater will not \nbe able to divert ali \nof the runoff reaching it.  Flows in excess of catchwater capacity will be lost \n(unless the overflow occurs within the catchment \nof the reservoir). Catchwaters often originate \nat an intake on another stream, \nor capture flows from streams they cross along their route. Intake \ncapacity and compensation flow  requirements may therefore be other limiting factors. In view \nof \nthe above, catchwater yield requires the evaluation of two main parameters: \na. the volume of water reaching the catchwater in the critica! period; and \nb. the proportion of total flow that the catchwater can capture. \nParameter (a) depends in turn on the capacity \nof the catchwater and the variability of potential \ninflows. One way \nof determining catchwater capacity is to install a temporary gauge and measure \nit directly during a period of heavy rainfall. If this is not feasible, the capacity may have to be esti-\nmated by hydraulic analysis (according to channel dimensions and gradient). \nIf the catchwater is  to be incorporated into a simulation model of the overall system, parameter \n(a) must be provided as  a long, historie flow  series while parameter (b) is  calculated by the model \nfor each time step. The time step must be short enough (15 minutes \ntoan hour) to represent the vari-\nability \nof flows in the inflow sequence. If the time step is too long, average flow  over the time step \nmay be less than the capacity \nof the catchwater, suggesting that ali of the runoff can be captured. \nIf the catchwater is  not to  be modelled using a long sequence of historie flows, the volume of \nwater reaching the catchwater and the proportion of runoff captured have to be calculated separately. \nThe former can be obtained from a flow duration curve (Figure 3.\n11) for an appropriate period; e.g. \nan average year \nora 2%  drought year. The proportion of runoff captured can then be obtained from \na catchwater transfer curve such as  that shown in  Figure 3.12. This shows a relationship between \ncatchwater size and percentage \nof runoff collectable, derived from hydrographs observed on small \nBritish catchments with average rainfalls \nof 1500 mm or more. However, the relationship was found \nto hold true against data from a tropical catchment, such as one in Singapore. Although Figure 3.12 \nstrictly applies to average annual flows, it can be used without too much error to assess yield during \na given season \nof the year, provided the appropriate average daily runoff for that season is used in \nplace \nof the average annual flow. \nThe catchwater contributions to the reservoir are added to its direct catchment inflow, so that the \nminimum yields for various consecutive months can be plotted on a diagram such as  Figure 3.13. \nThis shows the extra yield a catchwater provides for a given reservoir storage and the change \nof \ncritica! drawdown

Nevertheless, the technique g ives a satisfactory \nmeans \nof engineering water resource developments to achieve rninimum environmental da mage. \n3.24 YIELD OF WATER RESOURCES SYSTEMS \nIn relatively sparsely populated regions, water supplies are typically drawn from single sources, par-\nticularly where settlements are separated by large distances and it \nis impractical to link them. However, \nin more densely populated regions, water supply systems are generally supplied from multiple sources \nof varying types. There are numerous advantages in having integrated water supply systems: individual \nsources can be rested or taken out \nof comrnission for maintenance without undue interruptions to sup-\nply; and water can be transferred from a part \nof the system with a surplus to an area experiencing a \ndrought. The lack \nof a fully integrated system contributed to the shortages that were felt in the Yorkshire \nregion \nof the UK in 1995. However, estimating the yield of an integrated system is more complicated \nthan for a single source, largely \nas a result of the differing critica! drought periods for each source type; \nthe only practica! way \nof calculating the yield of an integrated system is  by computer simulation. \nIn UK Environment Agency Guidelines (EA, 2007) for the estimation of the yield of surface \nwater and conjunctive use schemes, the recommended approach includes behavioural analysis; a \nmodel is used to simulate the realistic operation \nof a water resource system   as currently configured \nus ing historie data corrected for current catchment condition\ns. The method further requires: \nthe  d  erivation \nof long, na  turalized  historie  sequen ces for  ali  inflows to  th  e  water resource \nsystem being modelled; \nsystem control rules linked to levels \nof service which allow for the introduction of demand \nmanagement practices to cut supplies during periods \nof drought; \nyield estimates to allow for the provision \nof emergency storage to accommodate the operational \nuncertainty regarding the duration \nof a particular drought. \nThe hydraulics \nof water movement around the system is not normally simulated by the model, \nbut realistic physical limitations such as pump and mains capacity are taken into account, as are the \nlimits and conditions imposed by   licence agreements. \nInflows to th  e system need to  be  for as long a pe  riod as  possible in order to re present the full \nrange \nof hydrological variability in the modelled sequence and to allow the company's target levels \nof service to be t  ested. If necessary, naturalized  historical flow records n  eed to be  exte nded  back  in \ntime, either by correlation with other long term records or by the use \nof rainfall-runoff modelling. \nDe mand is de\nfined  at model  nodes, which coincide with major demand centres. Base demand is \nthe average de mand over the year, to which a seasonal demand profile is   applied. \nThe deployable output \nof the system is calculated as the output to supply which can be met over \nthe whole pe riod \nof the simulation with the re  quired levels of service. lt is defined  by system perfor-\nmance throughout the worst drought in the record and takes account \nof the varying critica! drought \nperiods for different sources and parts \nof the system. \nSimple water resource simulation models can be developed using spreadsheets.

When the cont  ents \nare above the control  line the draw off may exceed the 46 Ml/d to su  pply (up to the limit of the treatment works capacity). lf the \ncontents fall to or below the control line the draw off must be limited to 46 Ml/d to supply. \nFIGURE 3.14 \nReservoir control rule. \nminimum storage required at the beginning of every month to ensure maintenance of a given sup-\nply  rate. \nTo produce a control curve of this  type involves calculating backwards  in  time, from an \nassumed zero storage at the end \nof each month of the year. By applying this  process to  droughts \nof every duration, it is possible to locate the maximum storage required at any time of the year to \nensure the   reservoir never quite empties at the assumed abstraction rate. Different abstraction rates \nwill require different control curves. A family \nof such curves is therefore produced, each for a differ-\nent leve! \nof supply. Hence, reference to the curves anda storage/water leve! ch art, can show whether \nthe   water level \nin the reservoir permits an increased a bstraction or not. \nReservoir control curves have to be based on the most severe droughts historically recorded, \nor \non  a 'design' drought of specified probability. Neither can forecast the magnitude of sorne drought. \nHence a control curve tends to be \nof more practica( use in permitting extra water to be supplied when \nstorage \nis high, than when storage is low. If a reservoir is three parts empty with the dry season not \nyet ended, most engineers would  attempt to  restrain demand, \nin preference to  relying solely on  a \ncontrol curve, which poses a significant risk that it might not apply to  what the future m\nay bring. \n3.26 RAINWATER COLLECTION SYSTEMS \nRainwater tanks collecting runoff from roofs or impervious surfaces form a u seful  source of drink-\ning water where daily rainfall \nis frequent, as in equatorial climates and in the   monsoon periods of \nmonsoon climates. The supply is particularly useful if local sources are polluted, since only simple \nprecautions are necessary to keep the rainwater free \nof pollution. \nFor individual  house rain water co\nllecting tanks the principal constraint is usua   lly the  size of tank, \nwhich can be afforded or which it \nis practicable  to install. Tanks up to 600 or 800 litres are generally \nformed \nof one piece of material a  nd are transportable.

Such tanks have the advantage \nt  10 CHAPTER 3 Hydrology and Surface Supplies \n3.27 The Likely Effects of Climate Change 103 \nthey are repairable if they leak. Tanks made of plastic plates bolted together tend to fracture under \nthe repeated bending caused by changing water levels and the fracture is us   ually unrepairable. Steel \ntanks made of plates bolted together tend to rust at the joints. \nRoof areas are not us ually a principal constraint provided houses are one storied. There is  usually \nan area of roof, which can discharge to guttering along one side, perhaps with a return along another \nside. Traditional roofing for  low  income communities is galvanized iron, but corrugated asbestos \ncement roofing, clay tiling and asphalt may be found. With house occupancies varying from six to \n12 people, about 12-22 m\n2 \nof developable roof area per person is usually available. \nDaily rainfall records need to  be  tabulated. The daily runoff to  the collecting tank is usually \ncalculated according to  the  roof area  available per person.  The runoff is taken as 95% x (daily \nrainfall -1 mm), the  1 mm deduction being for initial evaporative loss on the roof, and the 95% \nallowing for guttering overspill. Sorne field tests need to be  undertaken to assess the size \nof gutter-\ning required; where it should be located; and what allowance should be made for overspill during \nintense rainfall. Local practice and experience, where available, can act as a guide. Although UK \nrainfall conditions are not likely to apply overseas where roof rainfall collection systems are ma inly \nused, sorne UK publications can provide guidance (BS  EN  12056:2000: Sturgeon, 1983). If large \nroofs, e.g. of commercial premises, etc. are used, the use of siphonic outlets to guttering may achieve \neconomy in downpipe sizing. The siphons become primed by air-entrainment of initial flows, thus \nmaking the  whole head between gutter outlet and  the  bottom of the downpipe available for  the \ndischarge, reducing the size of downpipe required (May, 1982; May, 1997). \nCalculations proceed by using tria) abstractions over typical recorded dry periods, commencing \nwhen the collecting tank can be assumed full. It is convenient to  work on  'units of roof area' and \n'storage available per person', sizing this  up  later according to  the  average number of people per \nhousehold for which the design should cater. Operating rules for householders should be simple, e.g. \neither a fixed amount X per person per day, reduced to 0.5 x X when the tank is half empty. An appro-\npriate mínimum drawoff rate would be  8 litres per person per day, the basic mínimum requirement \nfor direct consumption (drinking and cooking purposes) (Section 1.4). It is necessary to add an allow-\nance for the bottom water and top water to  the calculated theoretical tank capacity. The top water \nallowance, about 150 mm, means the householder does not have to restrict his or her take until the \nwater leve) is that much below overspill level. The leve) can be ma rked clearly inside the tank. The \nadvised abstraction X has to be expressed in terms of commonly available vessels. A standby supply \nmust also be available \nto afford householders a supply when longer dry periods occur than assumed \nfor the calculation and also for rescuing householders who run out of water for any reason. \nAlthough house tanks will not give a sustainable amount in dry seasons of the year, they will be \nwell  used in the wet season because they relieve the householder of having to carry water from a \ndistance. The rainwater in the tanks does not need to be chlorinated, but tanks do need cleaning out \nannually. Mosquito breeding in tanks can prove a nuisance in sorne climates and specialist advice \nmay  need to  be sought as to  how  to  control it.  Water quality and treatment aspects of rainwater \ncollection are discussed in Section 7 .24. \n3.27 THE LIKELY EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE \nAnalyses of hydrological variability inevitably have to assume climatic stationarity; i.e. wet years, \ndry  years, floods and droughts ali  varying about a constant long term  average. This assumption is \nnecessary in  order to  describe the  variability in terms of a statistical or probability

The term climate change \nis used imprecisely. It is  essential, therefore, to understand the \ndifference between climate change and climate variability. \nClimate variability is  the natural variation of climatic parameters s uch as temperature or rainfall \nabout the long term average. Large variations \nin these parameters occur, both seasonally and from \nyear to year. Without climate change, these variations occur more or less symmetrically about the \nlong-term mean, which is effectively constant. The words 'long-term' are important here because \nclusters \nof hot or cold, wet or dry  years might produce short-term trends or cycles. These do not \nprovide evidence \nof climate change. \nThe climate can be said to  be changing when there is a clear trend in the long-term average \nof \none or more climatic parameters over a long period. Trends might be seen in maximum and mini-\nmum values as well as the mean, \nor may be observed in event frequency such as the period between \nfloods or droughts \nof a given magnitude. \nFew hydrological records extend back more than 50 years and so most are too short to identify \nlong term trends with much confidence. Where trends in river flows can be identified, it is difficult \nto  separate the effects \nof climate change from changes in land use, farming practice or urbanisa-\ntion. Nevertheless, conventional wisdom states that our present climate is changing and the possible \nimpact \nof this change on future source yields needs to be considered. \nClimate change predictions come from the extrapolation \nof observed values by global climate \nmodels, \nof which there are many. Model predictions vary widely although there is more consensus \non rising global temperatures than there is on changes to  rainfall or river flow. As  a result \nof this \nuncertainty, local or Government policy on how to take climate change into account may vary. Guid-\nance may also change as  the results \nof new research become available. It is  therefore advisable to \ncheck the publications and websites \nof national and international organisations for the latest ad vice \nor policy on allowing for the impact of climate change on yield. The situation in the UK is described \nbelow by way \nof example. \nThe \nUK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) coordinates research and provides scenarios that \nshow how our climate might change. A new set \nof scenarios (UKCIP08) has recently been published \nbut until these are incorporated into climate change methodologies, most \nof the guidance is  based \non the previous UKCIP02 scenarios. These present predicted changes relative to a 1961-90 baseline \nin monthly, seasonal and annual averages for \n15 climatic variables including temperature, relative \nhumidity, wind and precipitation. The predictions were derived using the climate model developed \nat the \nUK Hadley Centre and were made for three 30-year time slices up to the year 2100 assuming \nfour scenarios for future greenhouse gas emissions. The overall conclusions were that: \nthe \nUK will continue to get warmer; \nsummers will continue to get hotter and drier; \nwinters will continue to get milder and wetter; \nsorne weather extremes will become more common while others will become less common. \nFurther details and up  to  date information may be  found on  the  UKCIP website \n(www.ukcip.org.uk\n). \nThe UKCIP scenarios indicate likely future impacts on precipitation (rainfall and  snow) and \nevaporation but do not directly predict the effects on river flows and groundwater recharge that are \nneeded to  determine future yield.

{"id":"cmkjtrz56001jv5q8vvh962r2","content":"UKWIR; 2006; UKWIR; 2007). Factors are presented which enable  6 \ne e \n10 \nReferences 105 \nhistorie records of river flow to be  perturbed in  order to represent future climatic conditions. If \nrainfall/runoff models  are available for the catchments of interest, these can be used to derive flow \nsequences from perturbed rainfall data. Similarly, soil  moisture models can  be used to  estímate \ngroundwater recharge under future cbmatic conditions.  Wetter winters may increase recharge while \ndrier summers are likely to  shorten the  recharge period and  may  give \nrise to lower groundwater \nlevels at the start \nof the recharge season. The overall impact on  recharge therefore may  be hard to \npredict and require detailed modelling to derive credible scenarios. \nIf rainfall-runoff or rechar ge models  are not available, the guidelines provide factors to perturb \nhistor\nie flow  and recharge sequen  ces directly. These perturbed  sequences are then  used as  input to \ngroundwater or surface water system s  imulation models to determine yield at sp ecified  future time \nhorizon\ns. The impact on  yield in intervening years is  determined by  interpolation between  these \ntime horizons and the present-day baselin\ne. \nREFERENCES \nAckers, P., White, W.
